## 🧾 Script Outputs

### descriptive_stats.py

* Computes descriptive statistics (yards/game, points/game, plays/game, attendance).
* Generates bar plots saved in `/appendices/Visualizations/`.
* Saves summary CSV tables in `/appendices/Tables/`.

### uncertainty_analysis.py

* Computes bootstrap 95% confidence intervals for key metrics.
* Outputs results in `/appendices/Tables/Uncertainty.txt`.

### sanity_checks.py

* Checks for missing values and outliers.
* Outputs results to `/appendices/Tables/Sanity_Checks.txt`.

### bias_fairness_checks.py

* Evaluates subgroup differences (Home vs Away, Conference vs Non-Conference).
* Saves results to `/appendices/Tables/Bias_Fairness.txt`.

### sensitivity_analysis.py

* Perturbs numeric metrics (e.g., +5%) to test robustness.
* Outputs to `/appendices/Tables/Sensitivity.txt`.

## 📄 Stakeholder Report & Recommendations

* **Stakeholder_Report.docx**: Includes Executive Summary, Background, Methods, Findings, Recommendations (tiered), Ethical/Legal Considerations, Limitations, Next Steps, and Appendices.
* **Recommendations.docx**: Tiered actions (Low, Medium, High risk) derived from verified stats.

---

## 🔍 Verification & Reproducibility

* Run each script individually in the recommended order:

  1. descriptive_stats.py
  2. uncertainty_analysis.py
  3. sanity_checks.py
  4. bias_fairness_checks.py
  5. sensitivity_analysis.py
* Verify generated plots in `/appendices/Visualizations/`.
* Verify tables in `/appendices/Tables/`.
* Cross-check outputs with Stakeholder_Report.docx for consistency.
* Random seeds are fixed in scripts for reproducibility.

---

## 📈 Key Focus

* Data-driven decision recommendations for the 2025 season.
* Ethical and legal compliance in presenting player and team statistics.
* Transparency: all LLM-generated content is labeled and archived.
* Reproducible analyses with documented provenance.

---

## 🙋 Acknowledgments

* Builds on Task 05 (Python verification of Syracuse Football stats) and Task 06 (AI-generated narrative and video scripts).
* ChatGPT and Google Gemini assisted in drafting; all outputs manually validated.
* Visualizations and tables generated via Python scripts for reproducibility and auditability.
